# Vape  
  
One for the edgelords who blow clouds all day.  
Pass in a list of subdomains/domains/IPs/whatever and check whether they are part of a cloud providers range.  
  
I tend to check this when doing BB's due to false positives. I'm sure there are hundreds of reasons to continue the normal routine against cloud providers, low hanging fruit etc, but I tend to fine tune my flow based on the result.
